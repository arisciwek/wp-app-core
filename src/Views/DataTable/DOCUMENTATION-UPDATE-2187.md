**Purpose:** Comprehensive troubleshooting guide with real solutions from TODO-2187

**Target Audience:** Developers encountering problems during implementation

**Content:**
- 5 major issue categories with solutions
- Real error messages from production
- Step-by-step debugging instructions
- Complete code examples
- Quick debug bash commands

**Issue Categories:**

#### Issue 1: Email Column Problems
**Problem:** `Unknown column 'c.email' in field list`
**Solution:** Proper JOIN patterns for email from related tables

**Real-world scenarios:**
- Email from wp_users table
- Email from branches table (type='pusat')
- Email from first branch with email (subquery)

**Complete code examples for all 3 patterns**

#### Issue 2: AJAX 403 Forbidden
**Problem:** Statistics/panel returns 403 Forbidden
**Solution:** Remove duplicate handlers, use consistent nonce

**Debugging steps:**
1. Check for duplicate handlers (wp eval command)
2. Disable old handlers
3. Ensure consistent nonce ('wpapp_panel_nonce')
4. Disable conflicting scripts

#### Issue 3: Table Layout Problems
**Problem:** Columns overlapping/nabrak
**Solution:** CSS table-layout:fixed + JavaScript columnDefs

**Complete solution:**
- CSS file with fixed layout
- JavaScript configuration
- Width planning tips
- Column distribution examples

#### Issue 4: Empty Tab Content
**Problem:** Tab shows "Data not available"
**Solution:** Pass $data variable to template

**Common mistake highlighted:**
```php
// ❌ WRONG
ob_start();
include 'tabs/info.php';

// ✅ CORRECT
$data = $entity;
ob_start();
include 'tabs/info.php';
```

#### Issue 5: DataTable Model Best Practices
**Complete working model example with:**
- Proper constructor setup
- JOIN configuration
- Column definition
- Row formatting
- Filtering
- Action buttons
